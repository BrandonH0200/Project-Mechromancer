HOW TO ORGANISE YOUR ASSETS:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IN ORDER TO ORGANISE YOUR ASSETS, MAKE A FOLDER FOR EACH ASSET YOU MAKE, AND SAVE IT IN THERE.

WHEN YOU COME TO EXPORT THE ASSET READY FOR OTHER PROGRAMS (SUBSTANCE PAINTER, UNITY), MAKE A FOLDER WITHIN THAT ASSETS FORLDER FOR THIS TASK SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES EASILY.
